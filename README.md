# Flask Intro

In this assignment, you will take your previous assignment, Web Mad-Libs, and convert it into a simple Flask application, so that you are populating the views from a database. Here is what's required:

- A schema.sql file describing a table with columns: business_name, business_type, market_type, job_to_be_done, and revenue_model
- A layout.html file that will be templatized and only contain your 4 buttons
- A separate madlib.html file that will contain the actual mad-lib text (populated from the database)

It is optional to either populate your database by hand or to create a route that takes input from a form like shown in the example.

Make sure to rename RUMPELSTILTSKIN to whatever you wish to name you app. Make sure to change it *everywhere* it appears.

That's it! This assignment sounds simple, but it will be hard so make sure to start EARLY!!!

It is highly recommended to use a Vagrant box for this assignment, running Ubuntu 16.04.
